1. A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent.
2. The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to three points are described as “Love”, “Fifteen”, “Thirty”, and “Forty” respectively.
3. If at least three points have been scored by each player, and the scores are equal, the score is “Deuce”.
4. If one player wins a point from Deuce, they get an Advantage.

You need only report the score for the current game. Sets and Matches are out of scope.
